This is data indexed by date and/or time. For example, prices of stocks over time represent financial time series data. Similarly, the EUR/USD exchange rate over time represents a financial time series; the exchange rate is quoted in brief intervals of time, and a collection of such quotes then is a time series of exchange rates. \n","\n","There is no financial discipline that gets by without considering time an important factor. This mainly is the same as with physics and other sciences. The major tool to cope with time series data in Python is pandas. Wes McKinney, the original and main author of pandas, started developing the library when working as an analyst at AQR Capital Management, a large hedge fund. It is safe to say that pandas has been designed from the ground up to work with financial time series
